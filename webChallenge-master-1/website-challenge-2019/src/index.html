--READ THESE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY!!!--

This is a:

--WEBSITE CHALLENGE--

This is a deal for the entire class:

If all students make a professional-looking website
by the end of the course, we will have a class party. I will 
bring cookies and you can bring what you'd like. We 
will also set up our laptops and invite your
parents/guardians to see your work (maybe...We might include a link to
these in your report card).

In order to earn this party, you need to follow all of
the instructions inside the HTML, CSS, and on the pages
themselves. The instructions in the HTML are gray letters
between <!-- --> <!--brackets. The CSS instructions are
between the /* */.

I hope this is fun for everyone. Please take your time
and use Google and friends/family to help you.

PS: There is a bonus challenge hidden somewhere in this code.
If you find it and figure it out, don't let anyone know. 
I'll find it when I see your completed code at the end of the day and 
you'll get a prize at the party.-->

<!-- SOMETHING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DO!  if you are working in visual studio code, you 
  can install "open in browser" 
this will allow you to open your file in your browser super quick by clicking "alt+b" 
**BOOM**
your site is in your browser! (but not live online yet)

still, pretty neat.-->

<!-- FONT AREA (for step 9)

Eventually, you will have to erase them all and replace

googling 'Google Fonts' Then just grab the location for them and replace-->

<!-- By the way: You may have noticed a src folder and a dist folder in the explorer in vs code
  src/ stands for source, and is the raw code before minification or concatenation or 
  some other compilation - used to read/edit the code.
dist/ stands for distribution, and is the minified/concatenated version - actually used on production sites.-->
<!-- 4) This is the Portfolio tab. Follow the instructions on the Porfolio tab--> 

<div id="Portfolio" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>This is your portfolio!<br> Change these words to something descriptive!</h3>
  <p>Your portfolio is your most important page.<br>
    It needs to show-off your work and be well-organized.<br>
    *Write a few sentences about your computer/art experience.<br>
    Include your HTML and CSS experience, as well as any other<br>
    technical skill you possess. Do you have any certifications<br>
    from freeCodeCamp? Are you experienced with the laser cutter?<br>
    Think outside the box as you write.<br><br>
    *After you list your experience, include 4 screenshots of your <br> 
    best work (Jackie Robinson pages, Chronicles of Narnia, etc). <br>
    You can also embed Codepen apps to show any games or apps.<br>
    If you've made any videos or scratch projects, post them here.<br>
    This Portfolio page needs to look clean and professional,<br>
    so take your time, and feel free to make it your own.<br>
    You will probably need to upload your screenshots to <br>
    github.

    all of this text. I left this here because<br>
    if you are ever making <br>a website for a family 
    business or something similar,<br>
    contact information should be included. 
    <br>However, you don't need to include it for school 
    projects like this.<br>
