--READ THESE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY!!!--

This is a:

--WEBSITE CHALLENGE--

This is a deal for the entire class:

If all 22 students make a professional-looking website
by April 30, 2018, we will have a class party. I will 
bring Eeegee's and you can bring what you'd like. We 
will also set up our laptops and invite your
parents/guardians to see your work on a night in May 
before school ends.

In order to earn this party, you need to follow all of
the instructions inside the HTML, CSS, and on the pages
themselves. The instructions in the HTML are gray letters
between <!-- --> <!--brackets. The CSS instructions are
between the /* */.

I hope this is fun for everyone. Please take your time
and use Google and friends/family to help you.

PS: There is a bonus challenge hidden somewhere in this code.
If you find it and figure it out, don't let anyone know. 
I'll find it when I see your completed code on April 30 and 
you'll get a prize at the party.-->

<!-- 4) This is the Portfolio tab. Follow the instructions on the Porfolio tab--> 
<div id="Portfolio" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>This is your portfolio!<br> Change these words to something descriptive!</h3>
  <p>Your portfolio is your most important page.<br>
    It needs to show-off your work and be well-organized.<br>
    *Write a few sentences about your computer/art experience.<br>
    Include your HTML and CSS experience, as well as any other<br>
    technical skill you possess. Do you have any certifications<br>
    from freeCodeCamp? What level are you in Duolingo?<br>
    Think outside the box as you write.<br><br>
    *After you list your experience, include 4 screenshots of your <br> best work (Jackie Robinson pages, Chronicles of Narnia, etc). <br>You can also embed Codepen apps to show any games or apps.<br>
    If you've made any videos or scratch projects, post them here.<br>
    This Portfolio page needs to look clean and professional,<br>
    so take your time, and feel free to make it your own.<br>
    You will probably need to upload your screenshots to <br>
    github.

    post them here. If you want to change the name of this<br>
    tab to something else, please do it. You can choose to<br>

    contact information should be included. <br>However, you don't need to include it for school projects like this.<br>
